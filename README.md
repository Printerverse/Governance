# Printerverse Governance
*"Transparency is not the enemy of profitability. In fact, it is a catalyst for trust, accountability, and innovation. When stakeholders have access to information and participate in decision-making, the cooperative spirit flourishes, paving the way for sustainable success."* 
-ChatGPT, May2023

## Open Source Business
We are an open source business that maintains transparency in its systems and processes to build a community-driven organization. We have posted our legal documentation on this Github Repository for scrutiny and improvement by the Printerverse Community as per our Open Source Business policy. We believe it is important to encourage our users to feel safe in the operations of Printerverse. We welcome all recommendations to change certain policies in a way that is beneficial for everyone.

## Cooperative Structure 
The business operates as a cooperative, where all stakeholders, such as our partners, employees, customers, and suppliers, have a say in the decision-making processes. The cooperative structure ensures that everyone involved has access to and contributes to the organization's information and operations. We encourage critical-thinking and debate at every step of our journey. 

## Our Partners
We make our partnership agreements public, sharing the terms, objectives, and responsibilities with the wider community. This transparency promotes trust and accountability among stakeholders, showcasing the organization's commitment to fair and ethical business practices. While maintaining transparency in other areas, we keep our financial information private.

## Community Engagement
We encourage actively engagement within our community, seeking input and feedback on our operations, goals, and initiatives. 
Regular meetings and open forums on [Discord](https://discord.gg/SBBkKk2vqY) are used to facilitate dialogue and collaboration. 
This way, the organization benefits from the collective intelligence and expertise of its community, enabling continuous improvement at a rapid pace.
