# Shipping Policy

We strive to provide a seamless and convenient shopping experience for our customers. 
This shipping policy outlines important information regarding the shipping and delivery of our 3D printing filament, 3D printers, and their spare parts. 
Please note that Printerverse acts as an economic facilitator and does not stock any inventory. 
We have a network of regional partner companies ("Fulfillment Partner") that stock inventory and are committed to fulfilling orders placed by Printerverse users.

## Order Processing:
   1. All orders will be processed by Printerverse within 1-2 business days (excluding weekends and holidays) from the date of purchase.
   2. After initial processing, the order is received by a Fulfillment Partner who would have their own lead time for fulfillment. 
   3. We will notify the user of the total proposed lead time at the time of purchase.
   b. In the case of any unforeseen circumstances or product availability issues, we will notify the user promptly and work to resolve the matter.

## Shipping Methods and Carriers:
   1. We use Shiprocket to offer a variety of shipping methods to ensure flexibility and convenience. The available options will be displayed during the checkout process.
   2. The selection of shipping carriers will depend on factors such as destination, package weight, and dimensions.
   3. Our mode of shipping might vary depending on the preferances of the Fulfillment Partner. 
   4. In some cases, we use the logistics network of the Fulfillment Partner rather than using Shiprocket.

## Shipping Destinations:
   1. We currently ship to certain limited regions of the world and to select international destinations depending on the preferences of the Fulfillment Partners. Please refer to the available shipping options during checkout for specific countries and regions.
   2. Please note that customs duties, taxes, or any other import fees associated with international shipments are the responsibility of the customer.

## Shipping Costs:
   1. The shipping cost will be calculated based on the selected shipping method, destination, package weight, and dimensions. The applicable shipping charges will be displayed during the checkout process.
   2. We may offer free shipping promotions for specific products or order thresholds. Such promotions, if applicable, will be clearly communicated during the checkout process.

## Order Tracking:
   1. Once your order has been shipped, we will provide you with a tracking number and a link to track your package's progress.
   2. You can access the tracking information by visiting the orders page on our app or by using the tracking link provided via email.

## Delivery Time:
   1. The estimated delivery time will depend on the selected shipping method and the destination.
   2. Please note that unforeseen circumstances such as weather conditions or transportation delays may affect the delivery schedule. However, we will make every effort to ensure timely delivery.

## Order Modifications and Cancellations:
   1. If you need to modify or cancel your order, please contact our customer support team as soon as possible. We will do our best to accommodate your request, provided that the order has not already been shipped.

## Damaged or Lost Shipments:
   1. In the event that your shipment arrives damaged, please contact us immediately with details and supporting evidence, such as photographs or videos. We will initiate a claim with the shipping carrier and Fulfillment Partner and work towards a resolution.
   2. If a package is confirmed lost by the shipping carrier, we will also initiate an investigation and take appropriate action to resolve the issue and ensure your satisfaction.

## Returns and Exchanges:
   1. Please refer to our separate Return Policy for detailed information regarding returns, exchanges, and warranty coverage for our products.
