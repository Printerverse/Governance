#### **Footnote by the CEO**
> It's impossible for a T&C document to cover all possible use cases while being small enough to actually be understandable without sending it to a lawyer or getting bored. A rational & civilized human-being understands what misuse is. If you are reading this document to find loopholes, let me cover it all by saying **'Don't do what you're not supposed to do'**. Printerverse was built by people much smarter than you. You will be caught and you will be met with the appropriate legal consequences. I'm sure my lawyers are better than yours. Don't do something that would make your mom cry. Have an amazing day and Welcome to Printerverse!
